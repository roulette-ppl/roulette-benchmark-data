# EMPTY DIRECTORIES

I don't know why, but Github does this annoying thing where an empty directory
will not appear in the repo. ie. If results/ has nothing inside of it, Github 
wont show it, and cloning the repo will not contain the directory either.


So the sole purpose of this file is so that, when there are no other files inside
results/, the results directory still exists (also to document my rant about this
issue)
